\chapter{Project Abstract}

The proliferation of online banking has revolutionized the way financial transactions are
conducted, offering unparalleled convenience and accessibility. However, with this
convenience comes the challenge of ensuring robust security measures to protect sensitive
financial data and prevent unauthorized access.

This project aims to address these challenges by proposing innovative solutions to enhance
both security and user experience in online banking systems.

The project will begin with a comprehensive analysis of existing security protocols and user
interface designs in online banking systems. This analysis will identify potential
vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Subsequently, the project will focus on the
development and implementation of advanced security measures such as multi-factor
authentication, encryption techniques, and real-time fraud detection algorithms.

Additionally, user-centric design principles will be employed to create intuitive and user-
friendly interfaces that enhance the overall banking experience.

The effectiveness of the proposed solutions will be evaluated through rigorous testing
procedures, including simulated cyber-attacks and user feedback surveys. Furthermore, the
project will explore the integration of emerging technologies such as biometrics and
blockchain to further enhance security and streamline transactions.

By the conclusion of this project, we anticipate significant advancements in the security and
usability of online banking systems. These advancements will not only bolster consumer
trust and confidence but also contribute to the continued growth and evolution of digital
banking services in an increasingly interconnected world.

\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Software \& Modules Used}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Python:}
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
    simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data
    analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python's extensive libraries
    and frameworks make it a popular choice for building web applications. In
    this project, Python is used for server-side scripting and handling
    backend logic.

    \item \textbf{UV:}
    UV, developed by astral.sh, is a modern package manager for Python that
    simplifies the process of managing dependencies and packages. It provides a
    user-friendly interface for installing, updating, and managing Python
    packages. UV is designed to work seamlessly with pip, the default package
    manager for Python, and offers additional features like dependency
    resolution and version management. In this project, UV is used to manage
    the project's dependencies and ensure that all required packages are
    installed correctly.

    \item \textbf{Flask:}
    Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows developers to
    build web applications quickly and easily. It provides a simple and
    flexible way to create web applications, making it ideal for small to
    medium-sized projects. Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway
    Interface) standard and is designed to be easy to use and extend. In this
    project, Flask is used to create the web application and handle HTTP
    requests.

    \item \textbf{MySQL:}
    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is widely
    used for web applications and is known for its reliability and performance.
    MySQL allows you to store and retrieve data efficiently, and it supports
    SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases. In
    this project, MySQL is used to store user information, transaction details,
    and other relevant data. This project uses the MariaDB version of MySQL,
    which is an open-source fork of MySQL that is fully compatible with it.

    \item \textbf{Jinja2:}
    Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python that allows you to create dynamic
    HTML pages. It enables you to separate the presentation layer from the
    application logic, making it easier to manage and maintain your web
    application. Jinja2 provides features like template inheritance, macros,
    and filters, allowing you to create reusable templates. In this project,
    Jinja2 is used to render HTML templates for the frontend of the web
    application.

    \item \textbf{Git:}
    Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track
    changes in your codebase. It is widely used for source code management in
    software development. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same
    project simultaneously without conflicts. It provides features like
    branching, merging, and version history, making it easier to collaborate on
    projects.

    \item \textbf{GitHub:}
    GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It
    provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, making it
    easier to collaborate with other developers. GitHub also offers features
    like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools, making it
    a popular choice for open-source projects and team collaboration.

    \item \textbf{Code Editor (Visual Studio Code):}
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code
    editor that runs on your desktop. It is available for Windows, macOS, and
    Linux. VS Code includes support for debugging, syntax highlighting,
    intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded
    Git. It also has a rich ecosystem of extensions for additional features
    and functionality.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Installation Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Install UV}
    Follow the official UV installation guide to set up Deno on your system.
    You can find the installation instructions at
    \url{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/}. Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your

    \item \textbf{Install Git:}
    Download and install Git from the official website:
    \url{https://git-scm.com/downloads}. Follow the instructions for your
    operating system.

    \item \textbf{Project Setup:}
    Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        git clone https://github.com/Atan-D-RP4/wt_project
    \end{lstlisting}
    Navigate to the project directory:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        cd wt_project/flask
    \end{lstlisting}
    Now, simply run the following command to start the server:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        uv sync && uv run app.py
    \end{lstlisting}
    This will install all the required dependencies and start the server.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Structure of the Project}
\section{Overview}
The project structure is organized into several directories and files, each serving a
specific purpose. Below is a brief overview of the project structure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{app.py:} This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the
    Flask application instance and the routing logic for handling HTTP requests.

    \item \textbf{database.py:} This file contains the database connection and query logic. It
    handles interactions with the MySQL database, including user authentication and transaction
    management.

    \item \textbf{static/:} This directory contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript
    files. These files are used to style the web application and add interactivity to the user
    interface.

    \item \textbf{templates/:} This directory contains HTML templates used for rendering the
    frontend of the application. The templates are rendered using Jinja2, allowing for dynamic
    content generation based on user input and database queries.

    \item \textbf{pyproject.toml:} This file contains the project metadata and dependencies. It is used by
    UV to manage the project's dependencies and ensure that all required packages are installed.

    \item \textbf{.venv/} This directory contains the virtual environment for the project. It is created
    when you run the command \texttt{uv sync} and contains all the installed packages and dependencies
    for the project. It helps to isolate the project's dependencies from the system Python
    installation, ensuring that the project runs with the correct versions of the required packages.
