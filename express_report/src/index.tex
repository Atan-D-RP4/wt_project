\chapter{Project Abstract}

The proliferation of online banking has revolutionized the way financial transactions are
conducted, offering unparalleled convenience and accessibility. However, with this
convenience comes the challenge of ensuring robust security measures to protect sensitive
financial data and prevent unauthorized access.

This project aims to address these challenges by proposing innovative solutions to enhance
both security and user experience in online banking systems.

The project will begin with a comprehensive analysis of existing security protocols and user
interface designs in online banking systems. This analysis will identify potential
vulnerabilities and areas for improvement. Subsequently, the project will focus on the
development and implementation of advanced security measures such as multi-factor
authentication, encryption techniques, and real-time fraud detection algorithms.

Additionally, user-centric design principles will be employed to create intuitive and user-
friendly interfaces that enhance the overall banking experience.

The effectiveness of the proposed solutions will be evaluated through rigorous testing
procedures, including simulated cyber-attacks and user feedback surveys. Furthermore, the
project will explore the integration of emerging technologies such as biometrics and
blockchain to further enhance security and streamline transactions.

By the conclusion of this project, we anticipate significant advancements in the security and
usability of online banking systems. These advancements will not only bolster consumer
trust and confidence but also contribute to the continued growth and evolution of digital
banking services in an increasingly interconnected world.

\chapter{Objectives}

Here are a few objectives for your E-Banking System project:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a secure and user-friendly online banking platform that allows users to
    perform various banking transactions, such as account creation, fund transfers, and
    transaction history viewing.
    \item To implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized
    access to accounts.
    \item To provide an intuitive user interface that enhances the overall user experience and
    simplifies the process of managing finances online.
    \item To enable real-time monitoring of transactions and account activities for both users
    and administrators.
    \item To facilitate easy integration with existing banking systems and databases for
    seamless data management.
    \item To ensure compatibility with various devices and platforms, including web and
    mobile applications, to provide users with flexibility and convenience in accessing their
    accounts.
    \item To conduct thorough testing and validation of the system to ensure its reliability,
    performance, and security.
    \item To gather user feedback and make necessary improvements to enhance the system's
    functionality and usability.
    \item To explore the potential for future enhancements, such as the integration of
    emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning for fraud detection
    and personalized banking experiences.
\end{enumerate}


\chapter{Software \& Modules Used}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Deno:}
    Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, which is used to run the
    server-side code. It is a secure runtime that allows you to run JavaScript
    and TypeScript code outside of a web browser. It also serves a built-in
    package manager and supports ES modules.

    \item \textbf{Express.js:}
    Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for
    building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features
    for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and
    template rendering.

    \item \textbf{MySQL:}
    MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is widely
    used for web applications and is known for its reliability and performance.
    MySQL allows you to store and retrieve data efficiently, and it supports
    SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing databases. In
    this project, MySQL is used to store user information, transaction details,
    and other relevant data. This project uses the MariaDB version of MySQL,
    which is an open-source fork of MySQL that is fully compatible with it.

    \item \textbf{EJS (Embedded JavaScript):}
    EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with
    plain JavaScript. It is used to render dynamic content on the server side
    and send it to the client. EJS allows you to include JavaScript code within
    your HTML, making it easy to create dynamic web pages.

    \item \textbf{Git:}
    Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track
    changes in your codebase. It is widely used for source code management in
    software development. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same
    project simultaneously without conflicts. It provides features like
    branching, merging, and version history, making it easier to collaborate on
    projects.

    \item \textbf{GitHub:}
    GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It
    provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories, making it
    easier to collaborate with other developers. GitHub also offers features
    like issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools, making it
    a popular choice for open-source projects and team collaboration.

    \item \textbf{Code Editor (Visual Studio Code):}
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code
    editor that runs on your desktop. It is available for Windows, macOS, and
    Linux. VS Code includes support for debugging, syntax highlighting,
    intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded
    Git. It also has a rich ecosystem of extensions for additional features
    and functionality.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Utilize Visual Studio Code as the code editor for project development
        and editing.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Installation Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Install Deno:}
    Follow the official Deno installation guide to set up Deno on your system.
    You can find the installation instructions at
    \url{https://deno.land/#installation}.

    \item \textbf{Install Git:}
    Download and install Git from the official website:
    \url{https://git-scm.com/downloads}. Follow the instructions for your
    operating system.

    \item \textbf{Project Setup:}
    Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        git clone https://github.com/Atan-D-RP4/wt_project
    \end{lstlisting}
    Navigate to the project directory:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        cd wt_project/express
    \end{lstlisting}
    Now, simply run the following command to start the server:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
        deno run dev
    \end{lstlisting}
    This will install all the required dependencies and start the server.
\end{enumerate}
